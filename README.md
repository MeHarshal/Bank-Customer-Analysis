"Analyzed dashboard and gathered valuable insights about customers' behavior and preferences, allowing bank to tailor their products and services to better meet customers needs and improve customer satisfaction." 

**Aim of the study**

The aim of this study is to utilize an analyzed dashboard to gain valuable insights into customers' behavior and preferences. By doing so, the bank intends to tailor its products and services in order to better meet the needs of its customers and ultimately improve customer satisfaction.

**Data Description**

Here is a breakdown of data field I have in a csv:

1. Name: The name of the customer, represented as text or alphanumeric characters. It provides identification for each individual in the dataset.

2. Gender: The gender of the customer, indicating whether they are male or female. This field may be represented as categorical data, with possible values such as "Male" and "Female."

3. Age: The age of the customer, typically represented as a numerical value. It provides information about the customer's age group or specific age.

4. Region: The region associated with the customer, indicating their geographic location. This field may represent different regions or areas, such as cities, states, or countries.

5. Job Classification: The job classification or occupation of the customer, providing insights into their professional category. It may include various job roles or industries, such as "Manager," "Engineer," "Teacher," etc.

6. Balance: The account balance of the customer, representing the amount of money held in their bank account. It is typically represented as a numerical value and may include currency symbols or decimal points.

7. Account Opening Data: The date or timestamp when the customer's bank account was opened. It indicates the specific time at which the customer became a customer of the bank.

These fields collectively provide essential customer information that can be used to analyze and understand customers' behavior, preferences, and financial patterns. By utilizing this data, the bank can gain insights into customer demographics, financial trends, and potentially tailor their products and services to better meet the needs of their customers.
